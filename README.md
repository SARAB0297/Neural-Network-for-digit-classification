Digit Classification Using Neural Networks

Overview

This project demonstrates the use of a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It employs TensorFlow and scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model. The project aims to provide a simple yet effective solution for digit classification tasks, making it a great starting point for beginners in machine learning and deep learning.

Features

Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
Builds a neural network model using TensorFlow.
Evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy.
Includes visualization of training and testing results.


Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
TensorFlow, 
Scikit-learn, 
NumPy,
Matplotlib (optional for visualizations)

Dataset

The project uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).

Results

The neural network achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test set, demonstrating its ability to classify handwritten digits effectively.

Future Improvements

Add hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.

Experiment with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for improved accuracy.

Extend the project to include deployment options (e.g., Flask or FastAPI).
